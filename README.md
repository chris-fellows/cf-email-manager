# cf-email-manager

Tool for managing emails via POP or IMAP. It was created in order to be able to back up emails from 
Hotmail & GMail accounts so that emails can be deleted from the account but a copy is still available 
locally.

Future Changes
--------------
- Encrypt all locally stored emails & attachments.
- Add function to delete email from remote mailbox.
- Add system tray integration and automatically run download in background.
